# TODO

+ ensure all openweathermap and wunderground codes are accounted for.
+ allow unit change and format change without having to invalidate cache
+ on uninstall, prompt user to delete config file.
+ start dev branch and leave master as stable.
+ create a proper release 
+ check for node version on bin/terminal-weather invocation with '/usr/bin/env node --version'.  If it's less than acceptible version, notify user and exit.
+ try to get all api services to be self contained, i.e. no duplication of stuff in install command 
+ Launch an invocation to cache weather asap on initialization once you have the api key and the temp unit.
